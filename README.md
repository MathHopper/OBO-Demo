## Using this demo

This React.js web app demo incorpoating LangChain and CrewAI is intended to be a proof on concept for Object-Based Orchestration. The dataset is a database of all Chinese vessels which crossed into Taiwanese waters from the start of the year until mid-May. The manager-agent structure and tools are also used, which is provides the basic architecture on greater iterations of this project. This project was done quickly and some features need more improvement, particularly the coordinate extraction from the LLM response. Generally speaking, there are almost no limitations to the phrasing of user questions, but for best preformance, please use the provided prompts.

Provided below are some sample questions to best display the ability of the app:


How many vessels are in the database?

Which vessel MMSI spent the most combined time fishing?

When did vessel MMSI 412452223 enter Taiwanese waters?

What days is vessel MMSI 412452223 listed in the database?

Where was vessel MMSI 412452223 last seen?

How far is that from the coast of Taiwan?

Was there any other vessel listed with the coordinates (26.0, 122.4)?

Display the last 24 history of two of the vessels. //This will be the last command, since the paths won't disappear


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
